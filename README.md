# Solving-the-cold-start-problem
## What is the cold start problem? 
- The "cold start" problem is a common challenge in recommendation systems, where systems struggles to make accurate recommendations for items(in this case the music,movies and games) about which it has not yet gathered enough data.
- The data in this case is:
  - User interaction data such as the history of media items consumed/played.
  - User ratings and reviews.
  - User data such as age, gender, location, occupation etc
- This needs to be solved because it directly impacts the user experiance i.e for new users, the quality of initial recommendation can significantly influence their future engagement with the platform.

## Breaking down the problem
- The problem is faced by almost all recommendation systems and mostly systems around media content where the catalogue is vast and constantly changing.
- The problem can be broken down into :
  - New user cold start: How to generate accurate recommendations for new users who have not yet interacted with the system?
  - New item cold start: How to generate accurate recommendations for new items that have not yet been interacted with by many users?

## Approaches to solving the problem
- **Content-based filtering:** This method suggests items to users by analyzing the content of items that the users have previously engaged with. For instance, if a user has frequently listened to rock music, the system might recommend additional rock tracks. However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it limits the user’s exposure to diverse content.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** This method makes recommendations to users based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes. For instance, if a group of users has shown a preference for a particular genre of movies, the system might recommend movies from that genre to other users in the group. The problem with this approach is that it requires sufficient users and user interaction data which is not available for this particular platform.

## Best Solution: Two Tower Deep Neural Network(DNN) Retrieval Architecture

- This approach involves two seperate neural networks referred as **"towers"**.
  - **User Tower:** This takes user data as input and outputs a vector representation (also known as an embedding) of the user. This encapsulates the user 
     preferences and behaviour.
  - **Item Tower:** This neural network takes item data as input and outputs a vector representation of the item. This representation captures the item’s 
    characteristics.
- Once the vector representations are generated, a similarity score is calculated to measure how compatible a user is with each item.
- The items are then ranked based on the score and the higher the score the more likely a user is to be interested in each item.
- It is possible to use one model for movies, music and games recommendation in the platform but depending on the features of each item use of different models might be the best option.
  
## Improving the ranking using reinforcement learning
- Reinforcement learning is incorporated to improve the performance of the model.
- In this case, the agent would be the recommendation system itself specifically the rankingitems part of the system, the agent's action would be the list of items recommended to the user and thw reward function woukd be whether the user clicked on an item or not.
  
## Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision@k :** Proportion of recommended items in the top-k that are relevant, how many top-k recommendations are liked by the user.
- **Recall@k :** Proportion of relevnt items in the top-kecommendations, measure of the systemsbility to recommend items the user likes. 

## How would this look in Production?
- Since the platform itself is running on AWS, SageMaker would be the best tool for the job.
- The pipeline would be :
   - Data Preprocessing Pipeline - to preprocess new User data and Items added to the catalogue.
   - Model Training Pipeline - to train the two DNN models on the new data.
   - An Inference Pipeline - to deploy the system and make it available for users.
