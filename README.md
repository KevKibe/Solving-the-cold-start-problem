# Solving-the-cold-start-problem
## What is the cold start problem? 
- The "cold start" problem is a common challenge in recommendation systems, where systems struggles to make accurate recommendations for items(in this case the music,movies and games) about which it has not yet gathered enough data.
- The data in this case is:
  - User interaction data such as the history of media items consumed/played.
  - User ratings and reviews.
  - User data such as age, gender, location, occupation etc
- This needs to be solved because it directly impacts the user experiance i.e for new users, the quality of initial recommendation can significantly influence their future engagement with the platform.

## Breaking down the problem
- The problem is faced by almost all recommendation systems and mostly systems around media content where the catalogue is vast and constantly changing.
- The problem can be broken down into :
  - New user cold start: How to generate accurate recommendations for new users who have not yet interacted with the system?
  - New item cold start: How to generate accurate recommendations for new items that have not yet been interacted with by many users?

## Approaches to solving the problem
- **Content-based filtering:** This method suggests items to users by analyzing the content of items that the users have previously engaged with. For instance, if a user has frequently listened to rock music, the system might recommend additional rock tracks. However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it limits the userâ€™s exposure to diverse content.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** This method makes recommendations to users based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes. For instance, if a group of users has shown a preference for a particular genre of movies, the system might recommend movies from that genre to other users in the group. The problem with this approach is that it requires sufficient users and user interaction data which is not available for this particular platform.
